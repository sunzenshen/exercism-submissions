# Anagram

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```C++
#if defined(EXERCISM_RUN_ALL_TESTS)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C++11 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [CppReference](http://en.cppreference.com/)
is a wiki reference to the C++ language and standard library.  If you
are new to C++, but have programmed in C, beware of
[C traps and pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/LegalizeAdulthood/c-traps-and-pitfalls-for-c-programmers).
